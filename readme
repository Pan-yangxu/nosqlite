This is a simple and very lite nosql implement, in order to replace sqlite.

nosqlite now supports the following main operations:
    1. set - add or replace a record
    2. get - find a record
    3. remove - remove a record

advantages:
    1. only 300 lines of ansi c code
    2. it consumes very low memory, about 10MB for 1000000 records
    3. more better performance than sqlite, about 400000 qps

compile and run the test:
    gcc nosqlite.c test.c -o test
    ./test

NOTICE:
   the max value size is 64KB by default, that's because `NOSQLITE_VINT` is defined as `unsigned short`, if you want to store larger value you should add a compiling argument `-DNOSQLITE_VINT="unsigned int"`, also there's a testcase in `test.c`:
        gcc -DNOSQLITE_VINT="unsigned int" nosqlite.c test.c -o test
        ./test
