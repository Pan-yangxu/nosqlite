This is a simple and very lite nosql implement, in order to replace sqlite.

nosqlite now supports the following main operations:
    set - add or replace a record
    get - find a record
    remove - remove a record

advantages:
    1. only 300 lines of ansi c code
    2. it consumes very low memory, about 10MB for 1000000 records
    3. more better performance than sqlite, about 400000 qps
